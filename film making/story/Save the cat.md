	What is it 

Because if you can learn how to tell me "What is it?" better, faster and with more creativity, you'll keep me interested

there are four components to a logline -:
- it should be ironic
	-  A cop COmes to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and her officea good logline, once said, blossollls in your brain. You see thebuilding is taken over by terrorists - Die Hard


- a compelling mental picture 
	- you must be able to see a whole movie in it
	- Blind Date: "She's the perfect  until she has a drink.
		- you can see the full movie in it 

You can see the potential fireworks of one type of person being thrust into a world outside his ken.
scaredy-cat teacher and throw him into the crime-ridden world of his brother-in-law, the cop.

Does your logline offer this? Does giving me the set-up of your
comedy or drama make my imagination run wild with where I
think the story will go? If it doesn't, you haven't got the logline yet.
And I'll say it again: If you don't have the logline, maybe you should rethink your whole movie.

I admit that often I have come up with the title first and made the story match 

What's that, you ask? --> you will ask what is that

who --> the hero --> and SOllleone who can carry the movies theme

I hate to adlllit it, but I rarely begin writing any movie  with the "who" in lllind. More often it's the idea first.I think the "who" has to serve the "what is it?"

it means add the objectives

The logline tells the hero's story: Who he is, who he's up against,
and what's at stake

You've screened a dozen movies that are
in the category of story you're trying to tell

![[Pasted image 20231128124044.png]]
These are bookends. And because a good screenplay is about change, these two scenes are a way to make clear how that change takes place in your movie. The opening and final images should be opposites

It gives us a moment to see a "before" snapshot of the guy or gal or group of people we. are about to follow on this adventure we're all going to take

### Theme Stated

Who is greater in the overall scheme of things - the individual or
the group? And the rest of the screenplay is the argument laid out,
either proving or disproving this statement

### Set up 

this is the make-or-break section where you have to grab me or risk
losing my interest.

I make sure I've introduced or hinted at introducing every character in
the A story

The first 10 pages is also where we start to plant every character
exhibit every behavior that needs to be addressed later on,
and show how and why the hero will need to change in order to win.

And when there's something that our hero wants or is lacking,
this is the place to stick the Six Things That Need Fixing.

But there is a sense in the set-up that a storm'sabout to hit,

### CATALYST

telegrams, getting fired, catching the wife in bed with another man, news that
you have three days to live, the knock at the door, the messenger

	The world is now going to change

### MID Point

There are two halves in a movie script and the midpoint on page
55 is the threshold between them. We can talk about the importance
of the two act breaks, but to me the midpoint is as important,
especially in the early going of laying out a script's beats. I have
found, in reviewing hundreds of movies, that a movie's midpoint
is either an "up" where the hero seemingly peaks (though it is a
false peak) or a "down" when the world collapses all around the
hero (though it is a false collapse), and it can only get better
from here on out. When you decide which midpoint your script
is going to require, it's like nailing a spike into a wall good and
hard. The clothesline that is your story can now be strung securely.

### Bad guys close in 

after the mid point when the hero seems to have won ,  the bad guys again starts to reunite

### All is lost 

I started to notice how many great movies use the All Is Lost point
to kill someone. Obi Wan in Star Wars is the best example - what
will Luke do now?? All Is Lost is the place where mentors go to
die, presumably so their students can discover "they had it in them
all along."
It's where the old world, the old character, the old way of thinking dies

### Dark knight of the soul

### Break into three

![[Pasted image 20231128152840.png]]

### Finale

![[Pasted image 20231128153030.png]]

It's not enough for the hero to
triumph, he must change the world.

### Final image

the final image in a movie is the opposite of the
opening image. It is your proof that change has occurred and that
it's real.


# Save the CAt

hero has to do something when we meet him so that we like him and want him to win." Does this mean that every movie we see has to have some scene in it where the hero gives a buck to a blind man in order to get us onboard? Well no, because that's only part of the definition

	Pulp fiction and aladin example

# The Pop in the pool

# Double mumbo jumbo

Only one piece of magic per movie, please.
this is where the spiderman goes wrong , the green villan is a great turn off

# Black vet

getting stuck on a good idea.

# watch out for that glacier

Danger must be present danger. Stakes must be stakes for people we
care about

# Keep the press out

keep the press out of your storyline unless its about the press


![[Pasted image 20231128192500.png]]

The hero must be proactive

# Taking the plot

You have backstory and plot to explain, and there's no way to say it, so you resort to having your characters say it for you. And it sucks
" Well, you're my sister, you should know!"
You've forgotten that your characters don't serve you, they serve themselves. They should walk into each scene with their own goals and say what's on their minds, not yours. You must reveal who they are and what they want, their hopes, dreams, and fears, by how they say it as much as what they say. Good dialogue tells us more about what's going on in its subtext than on its surface

	show don't tell

# Make the bad guy badder

# Turn Turn Turn 

It's a CHASE! with no stakes , you can have lots of action and still not have a story. It moves forward, but there's no Turn, Turn, Turn

# Hi How are you I am fine

You're bored! of broing flat dailogues
Engaging characters talk differently than you and I
A character's dialogue is your opportunity to reveal character and tell us who this person is as much as what he is saying.

One stuttered, one did malapropisms,one was an Okie versed in Sartre, and the Alien parents (my favorite characters) always yelled

	Your hero must must must grow , if he is the same in the start and the end bro you are dead


- too many characters ---> every character must have one trait special which sticks to the readers mind
