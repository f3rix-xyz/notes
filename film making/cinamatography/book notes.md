One thing you will learn as a filmmaker is that everything has to be for a reason — for every choice
you make, whether in the story, the location, the props, whatever. Random choices do not help you tell your story.

Point-of-view (POV) is a key tool of visual storytelling. We use the
term in many different ways on a film set, but the most often used
meaning is to have the camera see something in much the same way
as one of the characters would see it

This is the crucial point: ultimately, filmmaking is about what the
audience “gets” from each scene, not only intellectually (such as the
plot) but also emotionally. Perhaps just as important, at the end of
each scene are they still asking themselves, “I wonder what happens
next?” In other words, are they still interested in the story?

how we perceive the world in a film is fundamentally different from how we perceive the world
with our eyes and ears. Film only presents the illusion of the reality.

# Language of the lens

basic rule of camera position and staging is that the importance of an
object in the story should equal its size in frame.

shot of any type, you are free to come back to the scene with a new

texture of the subject from the shadows. Light that comes from near
the camera creates no shadows. The more that light comes from the
side, the more it creates shadows, which is what reveals texture. Tex-
ture can also be present in the lighting itself

Even though the sun is a large star, it is so far away
that it appears as a small object in the sky — which makes it a fairly
hard light.

Another way is to direct the light through diffusion. In the past,
photographers used things like thick white tracing paper or white
shower curtains as diffusion

## Direction of light

The most commonly used
terminology is front, 3/4 front, side, 3/4 back, and backlight

If most of the light comes from the side or back, the
scene will tend to be “darker,” more mysterious, more dramatic.

Avoid Flat Front Lighting
Flat front lighting occurs when the key light is very close to the
camera. The result is an image with few if any shadows and very
little depth or dimension. The result is an image that is very flat
and without shape. Also, the subject is rarely separated from the
background or other objects in the frame.

overall lighting level and then the comparative difference between lights
in a scene — which is usually referred to as the contrast ratio between
the key and fill.

Especially on larger sets, it is often difficult or impractical to light
every corner of the set with many different hard or soft light units. It
is often better to establish an ambient base — which means to simply
fill the set with a soft, featureless overhead light

• Bouncing a light off the ceiling

Most of the time when we are shooting at
24 frames-per-second (FPS), then our shutter speed is 1/48th of a
second. In each frame, the light is falling on the film or sensor for
1/48th of a second. If we have way too much light for the iris to help
us with, then if we expose each frame for a much shorter time, then
there will be less exposure in every frame — problem solved.

There are many ways to find a motivation for a camera move, and
they can be used to enhance the scene and add a layer of meaning
beyond the shots themselves. They can also add a sense of energy,
joy, menace, sadness, or any other emotional overlay. Camera move-
ment is much like the pacing of music
