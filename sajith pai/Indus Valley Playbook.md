India would be the third largest market after USA and China.India’s venture market at $3.5b invested, after $15b in China and $37b in USA. Not bad from where we started out.

#### Forcing Functions

**A low per capita GPD**

- India’s per capita income: ~$2k, placing it in the bottom quartile of nations.
- India ranks 5th/6th globally in total economic output due to its large population.
- India1: ~10% of the population (110-120m people, 25-30m households) forms a consuming class.
- India1 per capita income: ~$9k (similar to Mexico, lower OECD rungs), contributing ~$1tn to the economy.
- India1 characteristics: English-speaking, western attitudes, white-collar jobs, globally connected.

thanks to Jio and cheap bandwidth, we have seen an explosion of less affluent, non-English speaking consumers come aboard the Indian internet. I refer to these consumers as India2.

**A sizeable high quality tech workforce**, comfortable in English and who wouldn’t be out of place in Silicon Valley firms

These 25-30m ‘English Fluents’ constitute the most affluent consumer segment in India (See India1 Alpha in orange in the graphic above illustrating The India Consumer Startup Stack). These are our Netflix watchers, our iPhone users, our Starbucks quaffers.

**An undersized and underformalized enterprise space**

There are 63m or so enterprises in India (USA, which is 9x our economy’s size has only half those many). Of these 63m, only 19,500 have paid up capital greater than ₹10crs.

India has around 49m white collar + fixed-term contract staff (this is just under 10% of the overall 493m labour force)

India has a visible and growing enterprise sector, it is still relatively small and underformalized. The relatively small size of the formal economy in India has important implications for startups that want to build large B2B businesses, as we will see soon.

`India’s strong presence in the venture league tables is extraordinary when you consider that our per capita income is $~2k and we are one of the poorer countries of the world. What could explain this?`

India's brain drain links its startups to Silicon Valley, easing funding and talent flow, unlike Japan or Germany, despite their wealth and markets.

success demonstrated by the startups funded in Wave 1 / Wave2 – these include both domestic B2C (_Flipkart, PayTM_ etc) and international B2B startups (_FreshDesk, Dhruva, Postman_ etc.)

the ever-standing promise of India as the next China! And now as a counterweight or alternative to China as it gets harder for US investors there

India's **etailing** sector, despite sparking the startup revolution and attracting major international investors, has shown relatively modest growth - reaching only 5% of overall retail ($38B) in 2020, lagging significantly behind China (32%) and US (20.5%).

The limited growth is primarily due to India's small consuming class (25-30M households), leading startups to innovate with various models like social commerce, group buying, and content commerce to reach beyond the core upper-middle-class market (India1) to the emerging consumer class (India2).

All of India has to take the same tests to get into elite colleges, or get into government jobs. Given this, **edtech** companies don’t need to innovate on interaction models like social commerce or content commerce, in order to expand into India2.

If ‘access’ is what edtech solves for primarily in India2 (and India1), then ‘identity’ is what it is solving for primarily in India1A. 

India1A students, from elite schools (IB, CBSE, ICSE), prefer holistic evaluations over competitive exams. While they historically studied abroad, rising costs have driven the growth of MERIT colleges like Ashoka and Krea in India, which assess students on academics, essays, and well-rounded profiles, including extracurriculars. Edtech startups like Uable and Lido Learning cater to this group by helping them craft profiles for global or Indian opportunities.


10 million alpha(affluent english speeking) indians are very close to us markets so what companies can do is  expand in usa , canada to same english speeking audience. its easier to do this in bits then atoms but possible in atoms too.


In the Indian context beyond the 50-60m affluent adults of India1 and perhaps the top 10-20% adults of India2 (about 5-10m people), there is a sharp drop off in purchasing power. This results in our undersized ad economy.

I feel. India1 audiences like us will remain attractive to advertisers.India2 audiences less so, and audiences here will be monetized through a combination of programmatic ad sales, in app payments, and perhaps even commerce.

SaaS in India faces challenges due to limited formalization and capitalization, with only ~19k enterprises having capital above ₹10cr. To scale, startups either expand globally or adopt a SaasTra model. SaasTra focuses on scaling quickly by offering free or affordable products (e.g., Khatabook, Classplus) to onboard customers and their networks, monetizing later through transaction fees or services like loans.
