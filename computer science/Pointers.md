```c 
int a; 
int *p; 
a = 5; 
p = &a;
print(p) //prints the address of a
print(*p) //prints value of a
```


- if p gives adress 204 then (p+1) will give 208 because p in a int pointer
- pointers as function argument --> a new variable forms in the func stack so to change origional variable you have to pass the pointers address
