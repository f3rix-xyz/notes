- ideas for startup , look at them like questions "will people switch for free likes?".  



-  To generate such questions you need two things: to be familiar with promising new technologies, and to have the right kind of friends. New technologies are the ingredients startup ideas are made of, and conversations with friends are the kitchen they're cooked in.  
  
- Universities have both, and that's why so many startups grow out of them.
- see if something is broken and u can fix them (dating sites in 2004 , millions of users but the experience was shit)
- Luxury â†’ Commodity: Make luxuries affordable to meet demand.
- Examples: Ford's cars, water mills, pastoralism.
- Impact: Cheaper = more sales; drastic cuts = new uses.
- Key: Solve core need, simplify features (e.g., Model T).

 - redefine problems --> You need a big prime number? Those are pretty expensive. How about if I give you a big number that only has a 10 to the minus 100 chance of not being prime?

- Making things cheaper is actually a subset of a more general technique: making things easier.
-  design for exits , look at big companies what do they need , 
- Just be sure to make something multiple acquirers will want
- work on hard problem , stay upwind , more options (maths > eco) , <s>passion</s> curiosity > discipline
- ship tha v1 fast
- Could you reproduce Silicon Valley elsewhere, or is there something unique about it?
- What it takes is the right people. If you could get the right ten thousand people to move from Silicon Valley to Buffalo, Buffalo would become Silicon Valley.
- who are these right people --> rich people and nerds and both are limiting reagent in this reaction
- What nerds like is other nerds. Smart people will go wherever other smart people are.
- So if you want to make a silicon valley, you not only need a university, but one of the top handful in the world
- If you want to attract nerds, you need more than a town with personality. You need a town with the right personality. Nerds are a distinct subset of the creative class, with different tastes from the rest. You can see this most clearly in New York, which attracts a lot of creative people, but few nerds.
- Most nerds like quieter pleasures. They like cafes instead of clubs; used bookshops instead of fashionable clothing shops; hiking instead of dancing; sunlight instead of tall buildings
- What you can't have, if you want to create a silicon valley, is a large, existing population of stodgy people.The startup hubs in the US are all young-feeling towns
- In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want.
- If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that. You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.
- <s>we are facobook for x</s>  we solve this exact problem
- don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's probably wrong
- Having No Specific User in Mind
- Raising Too Little Money will kill u
- Raising too much money will kill u
	- vc expect u to use that money
	- growing team 
	- can't change vision
- don't ignore or give in to ur investors
- If you're only doing a startup, then if the startup fails, you fail. If you're in grad school and your startup fails, you can say later "Oh yeah, we had this startup on the side when I was in grad school, but it didn't go anywhere."
- The biggest factor determining how a VC will feel about your startup is how other VCs feel about it
- good founders delight in breaking rules , but not rules that matter.
- People who are powerful but uncharismatic will tend to be disliked. Their power makes them a target for criticism that they don't have the charisma to disarm.
- Explain what you've learned from users.
- Would you use this yourself, if you hadn't built it?
- It's exceptionally rare for startups to be killed by competitors
- You don't need to worry about entering a "crowded market" so long as you have a thesis about what everyone else in it is overlooking
- because technology changes so rapidly that formerly bad ideas often become good without anyone noticing
- A good growth rate during YC is 5-7% a week. If you can hit 10% a week you're doing exceptionally well. If you can only manage 1%, it's a sign you haven't yet figured out what you're doing.
- Programmers will recognize what we're doing here. We're turning starting a startup into an optimization problem
