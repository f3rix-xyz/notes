- On Demo Day each startup will only get ten minutes, so we encourage them to focus on just two goals: (a) explain what you're doing, and (b) explain why users will want it.
- That might sound easy, but it's not when the speakers have no experience presenting, and they're explaining technical matters to an audience that's mostly non-technical.
- Say what you're doing as soon as possible, preferably in the first sentence
- Tip: One talks, another operates the computer.
- Reason: Speaker focus keeps audience engaged; multitasking causes distraction.
- don't talk much about bussiness model rather talk about the problem you are solving
- Seem confident.
- Tell stories about users.
- Professional investors hear a lot of pitches. After a while they all blur together. The first cut is simply to be one of those they remember
- best time to raise money is when you don't need it
- if you were a investor , would you invest in yourself
- you have a growth curve sure people will invest u then , but by that time you will be expensive , so great vc find out airbnb before it is airbnb
- is this person a leader and a very great communicator, is he razor focoused on product
- first santace --> 1 sentace --> describe ur product
